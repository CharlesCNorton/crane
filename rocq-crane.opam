synopsis: "Extraction of Rocq code to BDE-flavored C++ code"
description: "This project provides extraction of Rocq code to BDE-flavored C++ code, implemented as a Rocq plugin. It extracts Rocq into valid, performant, and memory-safe C++17 code. The generated code avoids garbage collection and does not need a separate runtime system, relying instead on `shared_ptr` for reference counting."
